# IoC Usage Guide – CVE-2026-24858 (FortiOS FortiCloud SSO)

📌 **French version available here:**  ➡️ [README_FR.md](./README_FR.md)

---

## 🎯 Purpose of this directory

This `ioc/` directory contains **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)** related to the
active exploitation of **CVE-2026-24858** affecting FortiOS with FortiCloud SSO.

⚠️ **Important design principle**

- These IoCs are **NOT embedded** in Sigma detection rules.
- Sigma rules remain **behavioral and portable**.
- IoCs are provided **separately** for:
  - blocking
  - enrichment
  - correlation
  - threat hunting

This separation follows SOC and Sigma community best practices.

## 📁 Files overview

### 🔹 `fortios_cve_2026_24858_ips_fortinet.csv`
**What it is:**  
IP addresses observed **directly by Fortinet** during active exploitation.

**How to use:**
- Firewall deny/block lists
- SIEM threat intelligence watchlists
- SOAR enrichment

**Confidence:** High

---

### 🔹 `fortios_cve_2026_24858_ips_third_party.csv`
**What it is:**  
IP addresses reported by **third-party CTI sources**, not directly by Fortinet.

**How to use:**
- Threat hunting
- Correlation (never blind blocking)

**Confidence:** Medium

---

### 🔹 `fortios_cve_2026_24858_sso_accounts.csv`
**What it is:**  
Email accounts observed being used by the attacker to authenticate via
FortiCloud SSO.

⚠️ These accounts **may change over time**.

**How to use:**
- Detection and alerting
- Investigation enrichment
- Never allowlist

---

### 🔹 `fortios_cve_2026_24858_suspicious_admin_names.csv`
**What it is:**  
Names of **local administrator accounts** created by the attacker
**after successful SSO authentication**, used for persistence.

❗ These are **NOT traditional IoCs** (IP/hash/domain).

**How to use:**
- Post-incident review
- Threat hunting
- Admin account audits

🚫 **Do NOT automatically block or delete based on name alone.**
Always validate context and creation source.

---

### 🔹 `fortios_cve_2026_24858_ttp_notes.md`
**What it is:**  
A summary of **observed attacker techniques (TTPs)**:
- Admin login via SSO
- Configuration download
- Local admin creation for persistence

**How to use:**
- Analyst context
- Incident response playbooks
- Training and awareness

---

## 🧠 SOC Best Practices Reminder

✔ Detection = **behavioral rules (Sigma)**  
✔ IoCs = **short-lived, contextual**  
✔ Always correlate:
- login source
- admin creation
- timeline

📌 **IoCs alone are never sufficient for detection.**
