# Time-based Correlation (5 minutes) – CVE-2025-59718

## Purpose (SOC context)

Public Proof-of-Concept exploits for CVE-2025-59718 demonstrate a clear attack chain:
1) Successful SAML authentication bypass
2) Immediate administrative access
3) Configuration export or sensitive actions

This document explains how to correlate Sigma signals to confirm a real compromise.

## Why correlation is not implemented in Sigma

This repository is SIEM-agnostic and validated using sigma-cli.
Time-based operators are not portable and may break CI.

Sigma rules generate atomic signals only.
Time correlation is handled by the SIEM or SOAR.

---
## Signals

**Signal A – Authentication / Exploitation**
- Generated by BROAD and STRICT rules

**Signal B – Post-authentication activity**
- Generated by SUPPORT rule

---
## Correlation logic

IF Signal A AND Signal B  
WITHIN 5 minutes  
FOR the same device and source IP (optional user)  
THEN confirm compromise

---
## SOC response
- Block source IP
- Disable FortiCloud SSO if needed
- Rotate admin credentials
- Review configuration changes

---
## Key message
Sigma detects what happened.
Correlation confirms what it means.
