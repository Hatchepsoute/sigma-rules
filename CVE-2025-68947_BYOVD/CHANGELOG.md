# Changelog

All notable changes to this detection pack are documented in this file.

This project follows a **detection engineering–oriented changelog**, focusing on logic correctness, behavioral coverage, and SigmaHQ compliance.

---

## [1.1.0] – 2026-02-07

### ✨ Added
- **BROAD Sigma rule** for early detection of BYOVD staging:
  - Suspicious kernel driver load of `NSecKrnl.sys` and renamed variants (e.g. `402.sys`)
  - Detection based on non-standard, user-writable paths
- **STRICT Sigma rule** for high-confidence BYOVD detection:
  - Kernel driver **service installation / configuration**
  - Detection via `sc.exe` or PowerShell service creation
- **Generic “Kill EDR / Anti-Malware” Sigma rule** (separate, reusable rule)
- SOC documentation explaining **recommended SIEM/SOAR correlation**
- Defensive playbooks and diagrams supporting pre-ransomware detection
- Community-ready README (EN / FR)

---

## [1.0.1] – 2026-02-07

### 🔧 Changed
- Refactored Sigma rules to use **generic log sources only**:
  - Removed dependency on Sysmon-specific fields
  - Removed explicit `EventID` conditions
- Ensured **SigmaHQ compliance** (`SpecificInsteadOfGenericLogsourceIssue` resolved)
- Clarified rule responsibilities:
  - BROAD = early warning (driver load)
  - STRICT = high-confidence (driver service install)
- Updated README documentation to match rule logic exactly

---

## [1.0.0] – 2026-02-06

### 🚀 Initial Release
- Initial publication of the **CVE-2025-68947 BYOVD detection pack**
- Detection focused on Black Basta (Cardinal) ransomware campaigns
- Behavior-based approach:
  - No static IoC dependency
  - Detection of defense evasion prior to ransomware encryption
- Initial Sigma rules, documentation, and references

---

## 🧠 Notes

- All Sigma rules are **behavior-based** and designed to be **tool-agnostic**
- Multi-event correlation is intentionally handled **outside Sigma**
- The detection strategy prioritizes **pre-ransomware visibility**
