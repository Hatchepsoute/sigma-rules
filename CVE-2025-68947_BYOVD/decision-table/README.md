# Decision Table — CVE-2025-68947 (BYOVD) Black Basta Campaign

[👉🏾  **French version favailable here**](README_FR.md)

## Purpose

This decision table explains how to interpret alerts generated by the **BROAD** and **STRICT** Sigma rules related to **BYOVD abuse of CVE-2025-68947**, as observed in the Black Basta ransomware campaign.

The goal is to guide SOC analysts from **early detection** to **incident confirmation and response**.

## Detection Logic Overview

| Stage | Detection Signal | Sigma Rule | Confidence |
|------|-----------------|------------|------------|
| 1 | Vulnerable driver load | BROAD | Medium |
| 2 | BYOVD + Security tool termination | STRICT | High |
| 3 | Ransomware execution | Out of scope | Critical |

---

## Decision Matrix

| # | BROAD Triggered | STRICT Triggered | Interpretation | SOC Action |
|---|----------------|------------------|----------------|------------|
| 1 | ❌ | ❌ | No suspicious activity detected | No action |
| 2 | ✅ | ❌ | Potential BYOVD staging or early exploitation | Investigate driver origin, file path, hash |
| 3 | ❌ | ✅ | Highly suspicious behavior (possible logging gap) | Immediate investigation |
| 4 | ✅ | ✅ | Confirmed BYOVD abuse and defense evasion | **Declare incident, isolate host immediately** |

---

## SOC Response Guidance

### Case 2 - BROAD only
- Validate legitimacy of the driver
- Check execution context (user, parent process)
- Increase host monitoring
- Prepare containment actions

### Case 4 - BROAD + STRICT
- Isolate the affected endpoint
- Assume **pre-ransomware activity**
- Check for lateral movement and persistence
- Activate Incident Response procedures

---

## Analyst Notes

- These rules intentionally focus on **defense evasion**, not encryption.
- Detection at this stage provides the **last opportunity to stop ransomware impact**.
- Correlation timing should be handled by the SIEM or SOC playbooks.
