# Why MVDR – Minimum Viable Detection Rules

 [👉🏾  **French version available here**](./README_Pourquoi_MVDR.md)

## Executive Summary

MVDR (Minimum Viable Detection Rules) is a security detection approach focused on detecting real and critical threats with the minimum number of effective rules. The goal is not to increase alert volume, but to increase decision quality.

MVDR prioritizes signal over noise and enables faster, clearer SOC decisions.

## The SOC Problem

Many SOCs struggle with:
- Excessive alerts
- High false positive rates
- Analyst fatigue
- Missed advanced attacks

More rules do not mean better security.

---

## What Is MVDR?

MVDR stands for Minimum Viable Detection Rules.

It means:
- Minimum: no unnecessary rules
- Viable: usable in real SOC environments
- Detection Rules: based on attacker behavior

MVDR focuses on correlation and critical attack paths.

---

## MVDR Is Not Less Security

MVDR does not reduce security coverage.
It removes noise so analysts can focus on what truly matters.
Less noise = faster response = reduced risk.

---

## Example: Kernel Rootkit Detection

Instead of dozens of low-value alerts, MVDR uses:
- One visibility rule
- One persistence rule
- One correlation rule

Result:
- Fewer alerts
- Higher confidence
- Faster incident response

---

## Business Benefits

For Management:
- Clear risk visibility
- Faster decisions
- Better SOC efficiency

For SOC Teams:
- Reduced fatigue
- Clear priorities
- Better collaboration

For the Organization:
- Improved ROI on SIEM/EDR
- Reduced incident impact
- Stronger security posture

---

## SOC Maturity Indicator

A mature SOC values:
- Detection quality over quantity
- Correlation over isolated alerts
- Actionable incidents

MVDR is a sign of detection maturity.

---

## Key Message

Security effectiveness is not measured by rule count,
but by the ability to detect what truly matters.

---

## Conclusion

MVDR aligns cybersecurity with business risk.
It enables detection that leads to decisions and action.
