# 📊 Decision Table – SOC Analyst L1/L2  
## CVE-2025-54100 – Windows Userland RCE

 [👉🏾  **French version favailable here**](README_FR.md)

## 🎯 Purpose

This decision table helps **SOC analysts (L1/L2)** quickly determine whether an alert related to **CVE-2025-54100** represents:

- a **confirmed security incident**,
- a **probable incident requiring validation**, or
- a **false positive (FP)**.

It is designed to be used alongside:
- Sigma detection rules (BROAD / STRICT),
- Endpoint telemetry (process + command line),
- Network logs,
- SOAR playbooks.

---

## ❓ Investigation Questions (Yes / No)

Answer each question based on available evidence:

1. Is the **parent process PowerShell** (`powershell.exe` / `pwsh.exe`)?
2. Does the parent command line contain **Invoke-WebRequest / iwr** (or `wget` / `curl`-like patterns)?
3. Is the **child process a LOLBIN** (`cmd.exe`, `rundll32.exe`, `mshta.exe`, `wscript.exe`, `cscript.exe`, `regsvr32.exe`)?
4. Does the command line indicate **download and execution**  
   *(URL + execution hints such as `-enc`, `IEX`, `FromBase64String`)*?
5. Is there **corroborating network egress** to a suspicious or untrusted host?
6. Is the activity linked to a **known IT operation**  
   *(change ticket, signed script, deployment tooling)*?
7. Are there **signs of persistence shortly after execution**  
   *(scheduled task, service creation, Run keys, startup folder)*?

## 🧠 SOC Analyst L2 – Decision Logic

### ✅ Confirmed Incident
**Condition:**  
- Question **1 = YES**  
- Question **2 = YES**  
- **At least one** of **3 / 4 / 5 / 7 = YES**  

➡ **Action:** Immediate containment  
*(isolate host, block IOC, escalate to IR)*

---

### 🟨 Probable Incident
**Condition:**  
- Question **1 = YES**  
- Question **2 = YES**  
- Question **6 = NO**  
- Question **3 OR 4 = YES**  

➡ **Action:** Conditional containment + evidence collection  
*(memory, full process tree, network scope)*

---

### ❎ Confirmed False Positive
**Condition:**  
- Question **6 = YES** with **strong supporting evidence**  

➡ **Action:** Close as FP  
*(apply detection tuning if repetitive)*

---

## 🚨 Analyst Notes

- One **YES** answer alone is **never sufficient** to confirm an incident.
- PowerShell + IWR usage **outside controlled IT workflows** is a strong risk signal.
- This table prioritizes **behavioral correlation**, not static indicators.

## 🔗 Alignment

This decision table is aligned with:
- MITRE ATT&CK (T1059, T1105, T1218)
- Sigma behavioral detections
- TheHive SOAR playbooks
