# 🐝 SOC Playbook – CVE-2025-54100  
**Windows Userland Remote Code Execution (RCE)**

## 📌 Overview

This repository provides a **SOC-ready detection and response playbook** for the critical vulnerability **CVE-2025-54100**, affecting **Windows Userland components** and enabling **remote code execution (RCE)**.

The objective of this playbook is to detect **real exploitation activity**, not just suspicious files or isolated indicators, by correlating **process execution, network behavior, and persistence mechanisms**.

## 🎯 Objective

This README documents the **actual operational logic implemented** in the TheHive playbook for CVE-2025-54100.

It is fully aligned with:
- Sigma detection rules
- YAML automation workflows
- L1 / L2 SOC decision tables
- MITRE ATT&CK techniques

## 🚨 Trigger Conditions

- **STRICT Sigma rule** – Primary detection, high confidence  
- **BROAD Sigma rule** – Context enrichment and threat hunting  

## 🧠 Core Detection Logic

1. PowerShell execution validation  
2. Detection of `Invoke-WebRequest` usage  
3. Child process analysis (LOLBins)  
4. Outbound network correlation  
5. Persistence hunting  
6. Decision: False Positive / Probable / Confirmed  

## ⚙️ Automated Response Actions

- Host isolation (EDR)  
- IOC blocking  
- Evidence collection  
- Incident Response escalation  

## 🧩 Alignment & Standards

- Sigma rules  
- SOC analyst L1 / L2 decision tables  
- MITRE ATT&CK  

## 🛡️ Scope & Assumptions

- Endpoint telemetry available (EDR / Sysmon)  
- Centralized SIEM logging  
- Designed for SOAR platforms (TheHive, Shuffle, Cortex XSOAR)

## 📈 Intended Audience

SOC Analysts, Threat Hunters, Incident Responders, CTI Teams
