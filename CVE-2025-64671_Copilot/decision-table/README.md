## Decision Table

| Step | Condition Observed | Analyst Level | Decision | Action |
|-----|-------------------|---------------|----------|--------|
| 1 | IDE spawns shell without suspicious CLI | Analyst L1 | Likely benign | Close as FP with note |
| 2 | IDE spawns shell + suspicious CLI | Analyst L1 | Suspicious | Escalate to Analyst L2 |
| 3 | Download tools (curl/wget/iwr) detected | Analyst L2 | High risk | Start investigation |
| 4 | External network connection observed | L2 | Confirmed malicious | Escalate to Analyst L3 |
| 5 | Access to .ssh / .env / tokens | Analyst L3 | Compromise confirmed | Incident |
| 6 | Persistence indicators found | Analyst L3 | Full incident | Containment + IR |
