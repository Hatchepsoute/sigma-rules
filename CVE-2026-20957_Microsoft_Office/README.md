# Microsoft Office Exploitation Detection – BROAD & STRICT

## Overview

This detection pack provides two complementary Sigma rules designed to detect Microsoft Office exploitation chains, including those related to CVE-2026-20957 (Excel Integer Underflow Remote Code Execution).

The rules follow a SOC-oriented detection strategy separating:
- visibility (BROAD)
- confirmation (STRICT)

This approach ensures durability, low false positives, and operational clarity.

## Included Rules

### 1. Microsoft Office Child Process Spawn (BROAD)

**Purpose**
- Threat hunting
- Early visibility
- Correlation anchor

**Detection Logic**
- Microsoft Office application spawns any executable child process
- No inspection of command-line arguments

**Why it matters**
Office applications do not normally spawn arbitrary executables during standard user workflows. This behavior is consistently observed during Office exploitation, including CVE-2026-20957.

**SOC Usage**
- Hunting queries
- Context enrichment
- Not intended for standalone alerting

**Severity**
- Medium

---

### 2. Microsoft Office Child Process Exploitation (STRICT)

**Purpose**
- Confirm exploitation
- Trigger SOC alerts
- Incident response entry point

**Detection Logic**
- Office spawns a known LOLBin
- Suspicious or obfuscated command-line arguments
- Legitimate Office update processes filtered

**Why it matters**
The combination of Office parent process + LOLBins + malicious arguments strongly indicates successful exploitation.

**SOC Usage**
- Alerting
- Incident creation
- SOAR playbooks

**Severity**
- Critical

## Detection Philosophy

| Aspect | BROAD | STRICT |
|------|------|--------|
| Goal | Visibility | Confirmation |
| Command-line analysis | No | Yes |
| False positives | Higher | Very low |
| Alerting | No | Yes |
| CVE specificity | Contextual | Explicit |

---

## CVE Context

Both rules are linked to **CVE-2026-20957**, but only the STRICT rule is CVE-specific by design. The BROAD rule intentionally remains generic to ensure long-term reuse across Office exploitation techniques.

---

## Recommended SOC Workflow

1. Deploy BROAD rule for hunting and visibility
2. Enable STRICT rule for high-confidence alerting
3. Correlate with network or file activity
4. Escalate via SOAR / IR process
