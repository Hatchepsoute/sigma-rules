# Sigma Rules Overview – CVE-2025-62557 (Microsoft Office)

This folder contains **two complementary Sigma rules** designed to detect real-world exploitation chains related to **CVE-2025-62557**, a Microsoft Office remote code execution vulnerability via embedded or remote content.

IMPORTANT:
Sigma rules cannot detect the vulnerability itself. They detect **post-exploitation behaviors** that reliably occur after successful Office-based exploitation.

## Detection Strategy: BROAD + STRICT

| Rule | Purpose | SOC Usage |
|-----|--------|-----------|
| BROAD | Detect suspicious context | SOC analyst L1 / Threat Hunting |
| STRICT | Confirm malicious behavior |SOC analyst  L2 / Incident Response |

---

## 1) BROAD Rule – Context Detection

**Objective**
Detect when a Microsoft Office application spawns a sensitive system utility 
(LOLBIN or script engine).

**Typical behavior**
winword.exe → powershell.exe

**SOC interpretation**
Suspicious but not confirmed malicious.
Used for triage, hunting, and correlation.

---

## 2) STRICT Rule – Exploitation Confirmation

**Objective**
Confirm high-risk exploitation behavior consistent with Office RCE.

**Adds strong indicators**
- Download from Internet (http/https)
- PowerShell obfuscation (-enc, IEX, Base64)
- Script-based execution

**SOC interpretation**
High-confidence incident.
Immediate containment recommended.

## 👉🏿  Key Takeaway

One rule provides visibility.
👉🏿 Two rules provide certainty.
