# Decision Table (SOC analyst  L1/L2) - Office Exploitation Chains (Global)

This decision table is designed to triage alerts where **Microsoft Office spawns LOLBINs/script engines**.
It supports Office RCE chains (e.g., malicious documents, embedded/remote content), including Patch Tuesday Office CVEs.

## Questions (Yes/No)

1. Parent process is **Microsoft Office** (WINWORD/EXCEL/POWERPNT/OUTLOOK/MSACCESS)?
2. Office spawned a **LOLBIN / script engine** (PowerShell/cmd/mshta/rundll32/wscript/cscript/regsvr32/bitsadmin/certutil)?
3. Child command line contains **download/transfer** indicators (URL, Invoke-WebRequest/iwr, curl/wget, bitsadmin, certutil)?
4. Child command line contains **obfuscation / in-memory** indicators (-enc, EncodedCommand, FromBase64String, IEX)?
5. Corroborating **network egress** to an untrusted host (new domain/IP, unusual geo, direct IP URL)?
6. Linked to a **known IT change** (ticket, signed script, approved automation, approved add-in)?
7. Signs of **persistence** shortly after (task/service/Run keys/Startup folder)?

## SOC Analyst L2 Decision

### ✅ Confirmed Incident (high confidence)
(1 YES) + (2 YES) + **at least one of (3 / 4 / 5 / 7 YES)** ⇒ **Immediate containment**  
(Meaning: Office spawned a risky child AND you have at least one strong malicious signal: download, obfuscation, suspicious network, or persistence.)

### 🟨 Probable Incident (fast validation)
(1 YES) + (2 YES) + (6 NO) + **(3 YES or 4 YES)** ⇒ **Conditional containment + evidence collection**  
(Meaning: no approved IT change exists, and Office spawned a LOLBIN with download or obfuscation patterns.)

### ❎ Confirmed False Positive
(6 YES) with strong evidence (signed scripts, known toolchain, documented automation) ⇒ **Close as FP + tune if repetitive**
