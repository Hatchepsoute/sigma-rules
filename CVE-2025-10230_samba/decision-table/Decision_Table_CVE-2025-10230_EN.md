# Decision Table – CVE-2025-10230 (Samba WINS Hook)

## Purpose

This decision table defines **SOC decision logic** for alerts related to **CVE-2025-10230**, a critical remote command execution vulnerability affecting **Samba Active Directory Domain Controllers** when WINS hook is configured.

The table is designed to:
- Minimize false positives
- Provide clear escalation criteria
- Be applicable to both real attacks and pentests

---

## Detection Inputs

| Rule | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **STRICT** | Samba daemon spawning a shell (proof of execution) |
| **SUPPORT** | Risky Samba configuration detected (WINS + wins hook) |

---

## Decision Matrix

| SUPPORT Triggered | STRICT Triggered | Confidence Level | SOC Decision |
|------------------|-----------------|------------------|--------------|
| ❌ No | ❌ No | None | No action required |
| ✅ Yes | ❌ No | Medium | **Risk exposure identified** – schedule remediation |
| ❌ No | ✅ Yes | High | 🚨 **Incident confirmed** – initiate IR |
| ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Critical | 🚨 **Critical incident** – immediate containment |

---

## SOC Guidance

### STRICT Triggered
- Indicates **confirmed remote command execution**
- Alert must be treated as a **security incident**
- Valid for **pentest and real-world attack scenarios**

### SUPPORT Triggered (only)
- Indicates **exploitable posture**
- No incident declared
- Requires **configuration hardening and patching**

---

## Escalation Policy

- Any **STRICT** alert → **SOC L2/L3 escalation**
- STRICT + SUPPORT → **Priority 1 incident**
- SUPPORT only → **Change / hardening workflow**

---

## Notes

- Detection is **behavior-based**, not PoC-specific
- Network scans alone do not trigger incidents
- Designed for SOC, CERT, and audit environments
