# 🧠 SOAR Implementations - CVE-2025-6218 (WinRAR)
French version available here: ![README_FR.md](./README_FR.md)
This directory contains **tool-specific SOAR implementations** derived from the generic playbooks for **CVE-2025-6218 (WinRAR)**.

The goal is to demonstrate **how Sigma detections are operationalized** into real SOC workflows using common SOAR platforms.

⚠️ These implementations are provided as **reference examples**. They are tool-oriented, not production-ready, and must be adapted to each environment.

## 🐝 TheHive Implementation

**Path:**
```
thehive/
```

### Purpose
Illustrates a **case-driven SOC workflow** using TheHive.

### Key Elements
- Case template for CVE-2025-6218
- SOC N1 / N2 / N3 task structure
- Severity & TLP handling
- Correlation logic (Traversal + Persistence ≤ 10 min)
- Optional Cortex responders

### Audience
- SOC Analysts
- Incident Responders
- Blue Team Leads

---

## 🔀 Shuffle Implementation

**Path:**
```
shuffle/
```

### Purpose
Provides a **visual and logical SOAR workflow** to automate decisions and response actions.

Shuffle is used here as a **low-code orchestration example** to demonstrate automation logic.

### Key Elements
- Alert-based triggers (Sigma / SIEM)
- Decision branches (Rule 1 vs Rule 2)
- Correlation timer (10 minutes)
- Automated containment actions
- Ticket / case creation

### Audience
- SOC Analysts
- Blue Team Engineers
- Security Architects

---

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

- 🔍 Detection-first (Sigma)
- 🧠 Decision logic second (SOC / SOAR)
- 🤖 Automation where it adds value
- 🧩 Tool-agnostic by design

> Detection without response is incomplete.
