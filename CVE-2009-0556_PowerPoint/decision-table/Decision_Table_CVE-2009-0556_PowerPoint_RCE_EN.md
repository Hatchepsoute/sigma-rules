# Decision Table – PowerPoint Suspicious Child Process
## Potential CVE-2009-0556 Exploitation

| Step | Detection Signal | How to Verify | Decision | SOC Action |
|-----:|------------------|---------------|----------|------------|
| 1 | Parent process is POWERPNT.EXE | Process creation logs | If NO → out of scope | Reclassify alert |
| 2 | PowerPoint opened a document | Command line contains .ppt/.pps/.pot | If NO → medium confidence | Continue triage |
| 3 | Child is a LOLBin | cmd, powershell, rundll32, regsvr32, mshta | If YES → strong signal | Escalate investigation |
| 4 | Suspicious command line | Encoded PowerShell, URL, DLL loading | If YES → high confidence | Prepare containment |
| 5 | Network activity after execution | Sysmon EID 3 / proxy / firewall logs | If YES → post-exploit likely | Block IoCs, isolate host |
| 6 | File creation or dropper | Temp/AppData/Startup paths | If YES → compromise likely | Hunt persistence |
| 7 | Persistence mechanisms | Registry Run, Scheduled Task, Service | If YES → confirmed incident | Full IR process |
| 8 | CTI reputation | Sandbox / VirusTotal / CTI platform | Malicious match | Confirm exploitation |
| 9 | Legitimate explanation | Office automation, test host | Plausible & isolated | Mark as false positive |

## Final Verdict Logic
- **False Positive (Likely):**
  Parent PowerPoint confirmed, but no suspicious child behavior and legitimate business context.
- **Suspicious:**
  PowerPoint spawns a LOLBin with limited or no follow-on activity.
- **Confirmed Exploitation:**
  PowerPoint spawns a LOLBin AND post-exploitation indicators
  (network, persistence, or malicious reputation) are observed.
