# Decision Table – Linux Sliver / FRP / LPD Masquerade Detection 
[👉🏾 French version available here: ](./README_FR.md)
## Purpose
This decision table helps SOC analysts triage and respond to alerts generated by the Linux detection rules related to Sliver implants, FRP reverse proxy usage, and LPD masquerading.

---

## Detection Decision Table

| Step | Alert / Rule Triggered | Key Question | If YES | If NO |
|-----:|------------------------|--------------|--------|-------|
| 1 | FRP Execution Detected | Is `frpc` executed from a non-standard path or by an unusual parent process? | Proceed to Step 2 | Mark as *Suspicious – Needs Context* |
| 2 | cups-lpd / microsocks Execution | Is the process named `cups-lpd` using SOCKS-related arguments (`-p 515`, `-w`, `-1`)? | Proceed to Step 3 | Investigate as potential misconfiguration |
| 3 | TCP 515 Listener Detected | Is a non-CUPS process listening on TCP port 515? | Proceed to Step 4 | Lower confidence – monitor |
| 4 | Sliver Implant File Created | Is `system-updater` or hidden binary created in suspicious directories? | Proceed to Step 5 | Continue monitoring |
| 5 | systemd Persistence Service | Is a suspicious `Updater Service` systemd unit created? | **CONFIRMED COMPROMISE** | Investigate further |

---

## SOC Verdict Guidance

| Condition | Verdict |
|---------|---------|
| Steps 1–3 only | Suspicious / Early-stage activity |
| Steps 1–4 | High confidence post-exploitation |
| Steps 1–5 | **Confirmed Sliver compromise** |

---

## Recommended Actions
- Isolate the host immediately
- Collect memory and disk artifacts
- Disable malicious systemd services
- Search for lateral movement indicators
- Initiate incident response procedures
