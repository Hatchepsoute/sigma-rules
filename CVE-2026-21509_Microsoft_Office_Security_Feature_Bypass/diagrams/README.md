# CVE-2026-21509 - Microsoft Office Security Feature Bypass

## Overview

This repository provides a **single, high-confidence Sigma detection rule** for **CVE-2026-21509**, a Microsoft Office vulnerability that allows attackers to **bypass built-in OLE/COM security protections** using untrusted inputs.

Unlike traditional Office exploit detections that rely on multiple noisy indicators, this project intentionally focuses on **one strict and deterministic signal** explicitly documented by Microsoft.

## Detection Logic (Final Diagram)

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Windows Registry Event] --> B{Access to COM CLSID?}

    B -- "{EAB22AC3-30C1-11CF-A7EB-0000C05BAE0B}" --> C[Security Invariant Violated]

    C --> D[[HIGH CONFIDENCE ALERT]]

    subgraph Context
        D --> E[CVE-2026-21509]
        D --> F[OLE / COM Security Feature Bypass]
        D --> G[Unexpected CLSID Access<br/>(Post-Patch or Post-Mitigation)]
    end
```

This diagram illustrates that **any access to the vulnerable CLSID represents a violation of a Microsoft security invariant** on patched or mitigated systems.

## Why only ONE detection rule?

Microsoft explicitly identifies the **core technical indicator** of this vulnerability:

- A **specific COM CLSID** `{EAB22AC3-30C1-11CF-A7EB-0000C05BAE0B}`
- Referenced in Microsoft advisories
- Used in public proof-of-concept exploits
- Explicitly blocked via the official COM Compatibility kill-bit

On a protected system, **this CLSID must never be accessed**.

As a result, monitoring this single signal provides a **low-noise, high-confidence detection** of exploitation attempts.
