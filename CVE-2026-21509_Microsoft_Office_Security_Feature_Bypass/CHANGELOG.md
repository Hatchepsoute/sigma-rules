## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-04

### Added
- Initial release of the **Sigma detection rule** for **CVE-2026-21509**.
- High-confidence detection based on **registry access to the vulnerable COM CLSID**
  `{EAB22AC3-30C1-11CF-A7EB-0000C05BAE0B}`.
- **Generic SOC playbook** describing triage, investigation, containment, and remediation steps.
- **Decision tables (EN & FR)** to standardize SOC response and escalation logic.
- **Mermaid diagrams (EN & FR)** illustrating the detection logic as a security invariant violation.
- Bilingual documentation (**README.md / README_FR.md**).

### Changed
- Detection logic intentionally designed as a **single-rule strategy** for robustness and portability.
- Removed process-based constraints (Office parent process) from the default condition to avoid
  false negatives and ensure compatibility across SIEMs and EDRs.
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping aligned with Microsoft advisory:
  - `T1203` (Exploitation for Client Execution)
  - `Defense Evasion`

### Fixed
- Resolved Sigma validation issue (**DanglingDetectionIssue**) by removing unused selections.
- Corrected Mermaid diagrams to ensure **GitHub-compatible rendering** (no HTML tags).
- Harmonized naming conventions across rules, folders, and documentation.

### Notes
- Optional tuning guidance is provided in the README to restrict detection to Office processes
  **only if** the `Image` field is reliably available in registry telemetry.
- This release is intended for **defensive detection and SOC operations only** and does not
  replace official Microsoft patches or mitigations.

## [Unreleased]
- Potential addition of a supporting hygiene rule to monitor COM Compatibility mitigation status.
- Optional correlation logic for environments with advanced telemetry.
