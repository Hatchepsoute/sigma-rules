# CVE-2026-21509 — Microsoft Office Security Feature Bypass (CISO / RSSI)
➡️ **[French version available here](./README_FR.md)**

## Objective
This Sigma rule is designed to **detect any attempt to exploit** the vulnerability **CVE-2026-21509**, which allows attackers to **bypass Microsoft Office OLE / COM security mechanisms**.

The detection relies on a **single, high-confidence technical signal**, explicitly documented by Microsoft.

---

## 🎯 Detection Principle
- Monitoring **access to the vulnerable COM CLSID**:
  ```
  {EAB22AC3-30C1-11CF-A7EB-0000C05BAE0B}
  ```
- On a **patched or properly mitigated system**, this CLSID **must never be accessed**.
- Any matching event represents a **critical security anomaly**.
