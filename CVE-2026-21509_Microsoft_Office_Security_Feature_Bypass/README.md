# CVE-2026-21509 - Microsoft Office Security Feature Bypass

## Overview

This repository provides a **single, high-confidence Sigma detection rule** for **CVE-2026-21509**, a Microsoft Office vulnerability that allows attackers to **bypass built-in OLE/COM security protections** using untrusted inputs.
Unlike traditional Office exploit detections that rely on multiple noisy indicators, this project intentionally focuses on **one strict and deterministic signal** explicitly documented by Microsoft.

---

## Why only ONE detection rule?

Microsoft clearly identifies the **core technical indicator** of this vulnerability:

- A **specific COM CLSID**  
  `{EAB22AC3-30C1-11CF-A7EB-0000C05BAE0B}`
- This CLSID is:
  - referenced in Microsoft advisories
  - used in public proof-of-concept exploits
  - explicitly blocked via Microsoft’s official mitigation (COM Compatibility kill-bit)

👉🏾 **On patched or properly mitigated systems, this CLSID should never be accessed.**
As a result, **monitoring access to this CLSID alone provides a strong, low-noise, high-confidence detection** of exploitation attempts.
This makes CVE-2026-21509 a rare case where **a single strict detection rule is both sufficient and defensible**.

## Detection Strategy

### Detection Type
- **Registry-based detection**
- Focused on **COM CLSID access**
- Independent of:
  - Office process names
  - macros
  - DLL loading
  - EDR-specific telemetry

### Why no parent process condition?
- Registry telemetry is not standardized across SIEMs
- COM instantiation may occur via intermediary processes
- The CLSID itself is the authoritative indicator

The rule remains **portable, resilient, and future-proof**.

## Sigma Rule

- **Rule name**:  
  *Microsoft Office COM CLSID Security Feature Bypass Attempt (CVE-2026-21509)*
- **Severity**: High
- **MITRE ATT&CK**:
  - T1203 — Exploitation for Client Execution
  - Defense Evasion
- **Log source**:
  - `category: registry_event`
  - `product: windows`
