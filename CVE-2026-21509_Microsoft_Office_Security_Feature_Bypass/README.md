# 🛡️ CVE-2026-21509 - Microsoft Office Security Feature Bypass Detection

👉🏾 **[French version available here](README_FR.md)**


## Overview

This repository provides a **single, high-confidence Sigma detection rule** for **CVE-2026-21509**, a Microsoft Office vulnerability classified as a **Security Feature Bypass**.

The detection logic focuses on a **strong and deterministic technical invariant** explicitly documented by Microsoft:  
the access to a specific **COM CLSID** that must never be instantiated on patched or properly mitigated systems.
---
## 📑 Attack Scenario: From Exploitation to Detection

To understand the detection logic, below is a typical attack flow based on public proof-of-concept material.

### 1. Preparation and Delivery

An attacker crafts a malicious Microsoft Office document (e.g. `.docx`) using a Python script.

The document embeds an **OLE object** referencing the following CLSID:

```
{EAB22AC3-30C1-11CF-A7EB-0000C05BAE0B}
```

This CLSID is **explicitly referenced in Microsoft security advisories** related to CVE-2026-21509.

The document is then delivered to the victim, most commonly via **phishing**.
---

### 2. Execution (Exploitation)

When the victim opens the document:

- Under normal conditions, Microsoft Office should block or warn the user before loading a risky OLE / ActiveX component.
- By exploiting **CVE-2026-21509**, the attacker forces Office to instantiate the COM object **without triggering the expected security warning**.

This results in a **security feature bypass** at the Office application level.
---
### 3. Observable System Trace (Detection Point)

To instantiate any COM object, **Windows must resolve the CLSID through the Registry**.

This generates a registry access to:

```
HKCR\CLSID\{EAB22AC3-30C1-11CF-A7EB-0000C05BAE0B}
```

📌 **This registry access is the exact signal monitored by the Sigma rule.**

On a system that is:
- patched, or
- properly mitigated via Microsoft COM Compatibility kill-bits,

👉🏾 **any access to this CLSID represents a strong security anomaly**, regardless of the originating process.

---

## 🎯 Why This Detection Strategy Works

- The CLSID is **explicitly identified by Microsoft**
- It is **directly tied to the vulnerability**
- It is **blocked after patching or mitigation**
- Its access violates a **security invariant**

➡️ This makes the detection:
- simple
- portable across SIEMs
- high-confidence
- independent of process name assumptions
