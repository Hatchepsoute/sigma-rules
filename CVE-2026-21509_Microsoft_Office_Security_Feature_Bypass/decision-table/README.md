# Decision Table - CVE-2026-21509 

## Purpose
This decision table supports SOC analysts in applying a **consistent, risk-based response** when the Sigma rule **Microsoft Office COM CLSID Security Feature Bypass Attempt (CVE-2026-21509)** is triggered.

This table is designed for a **single-rule, high-confidence detection strategy** based on registry access to a vulnerable COM CLSID explicitly identified by Microsoft.

## Decision Table

| Condition | Observation | Decision | SOC Action | Severity |
|---------|-------------|----------|------------|----------|
| CLSID accessed once | Single registry event, no other alerts | Suspicious activity | Investigate user action and opened Office document | Medium |
| CLSID accessed multiple times | Repeated events on same host in short timeframe | Likely exploitation attempt | Open incident, escalate to L2/L3 | High |
| CLSID access + Office document opened | User interaction confirmed | Confirmed exploitation | Isolate host and collect forensic evidence | High |
| CLSID access + suspicious child processes | Script engines, LOLBins, unusual executables | Post-exploitation suspected | Containment, threat hunting, IR | Critical |
| CLSID access on patched/mitigated Office | Security invariant violation | Security control bypass | Immediate investigation | High |
| CLSID accessed by security tool | Inventory, audit, or compliance scan | False positive | Document and tune exclusions if needed | Low |

## Analyst Checklist

- Identify affected user and endpoint
- Confirm Office document interaction
- Verify Office version and patch status
- Look for post-exploitation indicators
- Apply containment if risk is confirmed

## Final Classification

- **Suspicious**: isolated event, no supporting indicators
- **Confirmed Incident**: repeated CLSID access or confirmed document interaction
- **Critical Incident**: CLSID access combined with post-exploitation activity
