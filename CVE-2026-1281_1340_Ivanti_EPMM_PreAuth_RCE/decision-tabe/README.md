# 🧠 Decision Table – Ivanti EPMM Pre-Auth RCE (CVE-2026-1281 / CVE-2026-1340)

[👉🏾 French version available here: ](./README_FR.md)

This decision table guides SOC analysts in triaging and responding to alerts generated by the **BROAD** and **STRICT** Sigma rules for Ivanti EPMM pre-auth RCE vulnerabilities.

---

## 🎯 Scope
- **Product**: Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM)
- **Vulnerabilities**: CVE-2026-1281, CVE-2026-1340
- **Attack Type**: Pre-authentication Remote Code Execution (RCE)
- **Detection Layers**: BROAD (Hunting) / STRICT (High Confidence)

---

## 🧩 Decision Table

| Step | Condition Observed | Rule Triggered | Analyst Action | Priority |
|-----:|-------------------|----------------|----------------|----------|
| 1 | Access to `/mifs/c/appstore/fob/` or `/mifs/c/aftstore/fob/` from external IP | BROAD | Enrich source IP (geo, ASN, reputation). Check frequency & repetition. | Medium |
| 2 | Multiple requests or scanning pattern detected | BROAD | Classify as reconnaissance. Monitor and prepare escalation. | Medium |
| 3 | Bash injection pattern detected in `url.query` | STRICT | Validate payload, capture full request, escalate immediately. | High |
| 4 | HTTP status code 404 or 500 correlated with injection | STRICT | Confirm exploitation attempt. Open incident ticket. | Critical |
| 5 | Evidence of post-exploitation (shell, outbound traffic) | HOST / Correlation | Isolate EPMM, initiate IR & forensics. | Critical |
| 6 | No malicious follow-up observed | BROAD only | Close as hunting event. Update allowlist if needed. | Low |

## 🚦 Analyst Guidance

- **BROAD alerts** are *early-warning signals* → do not panic, investigate patterns.
- **STRICT alerts** indicate a *real exploitation attempt* → treat as an incident.
- Always correlate with:
  - WAF / Proxy logs
  - EDR / host telemetry (if available)
  - Network outbound connections

## 📌 SOC Rule of Thumb

> BROAD = Radar (visibility)  
> STRICT = Alarm (incident)
