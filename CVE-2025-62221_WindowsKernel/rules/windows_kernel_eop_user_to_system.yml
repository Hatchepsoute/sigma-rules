title: Suspicious SYSTEM Process Spawned from User-Writable Path (Possible Kernel  EoP)
id: dfceb26d-8c62-41e1-8dba-c6f929acb245
status: experimental
description: Detects suspicious process creation running with SYSTEM privileges where the parent process originates from a user-writable directory. This behavior is consistent with post-exploitation activity following a kernel privilege escalation such as CVE-2025-62221 (Windows Cloud Files Mini Filter Driver).
