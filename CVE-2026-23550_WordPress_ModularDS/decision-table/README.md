# Decision Table — CVE-2026-23550 (WordPress Modular DS) 
👉🏾 [ **French version available here**](README_FR.md)

This decision table helps SOC teams triage and respond to detections produced by the **BROAD** and **STRICT** Sigma rules for **CVE-2026-23550**.

## Detection Logic (at-a-glance)

- **BROAD**: REST probing / early exploit signals (including `rest_route=` abuse, plugin `readme.txt` enumeration, and `origin=mo` sightings).
- **STRICT**: High-confidence exploit attempt (POST + vulnerable endpoint + `origin=mo` + success status).

---

## Table

| Signal | What it likely means | Confidence | Immediate actions | Recommended follow-up | Notes / Tuning |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|
| **BROAD** hit: `rest_route=/` probing | WordPress REST enumeration / scanning | Medium | Collect source IP, UA, timeframe | Check other endpoints hit; block abusive IPs at WAF if needed | Common during scanning; tune by excluding known scanners if required |
| **BROAD** hit: `/wp-content/plugins/modular-connector/readme.txt` | Recon to identify vulnerable plugin version | Medium | Capture request details | Verify if plugin is installed; check exposure; consider rate-limit | Legit pentest / monitoring tools may trigger |
| **BROAD** hit: `rest_route=/api/modular-connector/login` | Targeted probing of vulnerable endpoint | High | Escalate to investigation | Look for repeated attempts; correlate with `/wp-admin/` access | Usually not legitimate in normal traffic |
| **BROAD** hit: `origin=mo` present | PoC-aligned exploitation indicator | High | Escalate, preserve evidence | Look for paired POST requests and successful responses | Keep because FP tolerance is low and `origin=mo` is strongly PoC-aligned |
| **STRICT** hit (POST + endpoint + `origin=mo` + 200/302) | **Confirmed exploit attempt pattern** | **Very High** | **Incident response**: contain, patch/disable plugin, investigate takeover | Review WordPress users, admin sessions, plugin/theme changes, file integrity | Treat as a security incident until proven otherwise |
| Post-exploit indicators (if available): new admin user, suspicious plugin upload, unexpected file changes | Successful compromise likely | Very High | Containment + forensics | Reset credentials, rotate keys, restore from clean backup | Not part of current Sigma web rules, but recommended for IR playbooks |

## Severity Guidance

- **BROAD**: Medium (hunting / early warning)
- **STRICT**: High (production alert)

## Data Needed for Best Results

- Web logs with at least: `http_method`, `url`, `status`
- (Optional) WAF/Reverse proxy response headers capturing `Set-Cookie` can further increase confidence.
