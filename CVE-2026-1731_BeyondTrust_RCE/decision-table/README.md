# CVE-2026-1731 – SOC Decision Table (L1 / L2 / L3)

👉🏾 [ **French version available here** ](./DECISION_TABLE_FR.md)

This decision matrix guides analysts through triage and escalation when one of the CVE-2026-1731 detection rules triggers.

---

# 🎯 Alert Classification

| Rule | Scope | Confidence | Severity |
|------|-------|------------|----------|
| WEB Recon (BROAD) | Web | Medium | Medium |
| WEB remoteVersion Injection (STRICT) | Web | High | Critical |
| LINUX Suspicious Shell (BROAD) | Host | Medium | High |
| LINUX Webshell Creation (STRICT) | Host | Very High | Critical |

---

# 🟢 L1 – Initial Triage

## If WEB Recon (BROAD) triggers:

- Identify source IP
- Check if same IP accessed `/nw`
- Review frequency and timing
- Check GeoIP / ASN reputation

### Escalate to L2 if:
- `/nw` also accessed
- Multiple attempts observed
- IP flagged as malicious

---

## If WEB Injection (STRICT) triggers:

- Confirm presence of:
  - `remoteVersion`
  - `a[$(` pattern
- Check if request returned 200 or abnormal status
- Immediately escalate to L2

---

## If LINUX Shell (BROAD) triggers:

- Verify user executing shell
- Check parent process
- Review command line

Escalate if:
- curl/wget/bash -c observed
- Unexpected network calls

---

## If LINUX Webshell (STRICT) triggers:

- Immediate escalation to L2
- Treat as potential compromise

---

# 🟡 L2 – Deep Investigation

### Web Scope:

- Correlate source IP across logs
- Check if appliance initiated outbound connections
- Review WebSocket upgrade headers
- Check authentication logs

### Host Scope:

- Review bash history
- Check for:
  - curl/wget downloads
  - reverse shells
  - suspicious PHP files
- Inspect running processes
- Check crontab modifications

Escalate to L3 if:
- Webshell confirmed
- Reverse shell identified
- New user accounts created
- Outbound C2 communication detected

---

# 🔴 L3 – Incident Response

- Isolate BeyondTrust appliance
- Block malicious IPs
- Rotate credentials
- Reset API keys
- Perform forensic acquisition
- Review lateral movement indicators
- Notify stakeholders

---

# 🚨 Incident Criteria

Immediate IR if ANY of the following:

- remoteVersion injection confirmed
- Webshell detected
- Suspicious outbound traffic
- Privilege escalation observed

---

# 🧠 Recommended Correlation

Correlate:

WEB Injection STRICT
        +
LINUX Shell Activity
        +
Outbound network connection

This confirms full exploit chain.

---

SOC priority: HIGH
Estimated impact: Full appliance compromise
