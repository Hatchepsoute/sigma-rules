# Sigma Rules Overview – CVE-2025-62554 (Microsoft Office)

This folder contains **two complementary Sigma rules** designed to help SOC analysts
detect **real-world exploitation chains related to CVE-2025-62554**, a Microsoft Office
remote code execution vulnerability caused by **type confusion**.

⚠️ Important:
Sigma rules **do not detect the vulnerability itself**.
They detect **post-exploitation behaviors** commonly observed after malicious Office
documents successfully execute code.

---

## Detection Strategy: BROAD + STRICT

| Rule | Purpose | SOC Usage |
|------|---------|-----------|
| BROAD | Detect suspicious Office behavior | L1 / Threat Hunting |
| STRICT | Confirm malicious exploitation | L2 / Incident Response |

This two-rule strategy balances **visibility** and **confidence**.

---

## 1️⃣ BROAD Rule – Suspicious Context Detection

### Role
Detect when a **Microsoft Office application spawns a sensitive system utility**
(also known as a LOLBIN or script engine).

### Typical behaviors detected
- WINWORD.EXE → powershell.exe
- EXCEL.EXE → cmd.exe
- POWERPNT.EXE → mshta.exe

### SOC interpretation
- ⚠️ Suspicious but not yet confirmed malicious
- Requires analyst validation
- Ideal for:
  - Triage
  - Threat hunting
  - Campaign correlation

### Why this rule exists
Most Office exploitation chains **start with this behavior**, regardless of the
exact vulnerability used.

## 2️⃣ STRICT Rule – Exploitation Confirmation

### Role
Confirm **high-risk malicious behavior** strongly associated with Office-based RCE,
including CVE-2025-62554.

### Additional indicators required
- Download from Internet (http / https)
- PowerShell obfuscation:
  - `-enc`
  - `FromBase64String`
  - `IEX`
- Download-and-execute patterns
- Script-based execution

### SOC interpretation
- 🚨 High-confidence malicious activity
- Immediate containment recommended
- Suitable for alerting and SOAR automation

---

## Recommended SOC Workflow

1. **BROAD rule triggers**
   - Analyst L1 validates document, user, and email context
2. **STRICT rule triggers**
   - Analyst L2 confirms incident
   - Containment and evidence collection

---

## Key Takeaway

> One rule provides visibility.  
> Two rules provide certainty.

Both rules should be deployed together for effective detection with low false positives.
