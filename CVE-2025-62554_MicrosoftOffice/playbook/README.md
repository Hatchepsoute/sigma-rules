# 🐝 SOC Playbook — CVE-2025-62554 (Microsoft Office)

## Objective
Operational playbook for **triage and response** to alerts aligned with suspicious **Office-spawned LOLBIN** activity that may follow Office-driven code execution (CVE-2025-62554).

## Triggers
- Sigma STRICT (primary)
- Sigma BROAD (context / hunting)

## Workflow (Analyst L1 → L2)
1. Validate Office parent process (WINWORD/EXCEL/POWERPNT/OUTLOOK)
2. Confirm suspicious child (LOLBIN/script engine)
3. Inspect command line (URL / download / `-enc` / `IEX` / base64)
4. Correlate network egress (first-seen, reputation, unusual geo)
5. Check for persistence shortly after
6. Apply decision table (Confirmed / Probable / FP)
7. Containment + evidence collection + IR escalation

## Automated actions (SOAR-ready)
- Isolate host (EDR)
- Kill suspicious processes
- Block IOC (URL/domain/IP/hash) where feasible
- Collect evidence (process tree, CLI, file drops, network connections)
- Escalate to IR if confirmed

## Evidence checklist
- Full process tree + timestamps
- PowerShell/cmd/mshta/rundll32 command line
- Dropped files in %TEMP% / %APPDATA% / Downloads
- Child process outbound connections
- Persistence artifacts (Tasks, Run keys, Services, Startup)

## Remediation
- Patch Office / Microsoft 365 Apps on endpoints
- Apply ASR rules to reduce Office→script engine abuse
- Enforce script/code signing (WDAC/AppLocker)
- Strengthen email controls (sandbox attachments, block risky formats)
