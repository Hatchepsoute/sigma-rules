## 🎯 Purpose of the Decision Table

Decision tables help SOC analysts:
- reduce subjectivity during triage
- make consistent response decisions
- align actions with asset criticality and threat confidence

They are especially useful when working with:
- BROAD detection rules (low to medium confidence)
- STRICT detection rules (high confidence)

---

## 🧠 How to Use

1. Identify which detection rule triggered (BROAD or STRICT)
2. Determine whether SYSTEM / High Integrity execution is present
3. Assess post-exploitation activity
4. Identify asset criticality
5. Follow the recommended SOC action

## 🧩 Relation to Other Components

| Component | Role |
|--------|------|
| Sigma Rules | Detect suspicious behavior |
| Decision Table | Decide what to do |
| Playbook | Execute the response |

## 📌 Notes
- Decision tables can be directly mapped to SOAR conditional logic (if / else)
- Decision tables are **SOAR-agnostic**
- They can be used manually or converted into SOAR logic
- They complement, not replace, analyst judgment
