## 🧩 Decision Criteria Explanation

### Detection
- **BROAD**: Suspicious behavior, not conclusive
- **STRICT**: High-confidence privilege escalation

### SYSTEM Context
- Presence of `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`
- High Integrity execution

### Post-Exploitation Activity
- Credential dumping attempts
- Service or scheduled task creation
- Registry persistence
- PowerShell with encoded commands

### Asset Criticality
- Low: Standard workstation
- High: Admin workstation / server
- Critical: Domain controller / sensitive infrastructure

## 🎯 Key SOC Guidance

- BROAD detections increase **visibility**, not alert fatigue
- STRICT detections represent **security-relevant events**
- Context determines **priority**, not the rule alone
