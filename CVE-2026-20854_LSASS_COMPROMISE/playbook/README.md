# TheHive Playbook – LSASS Compromise (CVE-2026-20854)
👉🏾 [ **French version available here** ](./Playbook_CVE-2026-20854_FR.md)
## 1. Purpose

This playbook guides SOC analysts through the investigation and response process when a **correlated detection indicates a potential LSASS compromise** related to **CVE-2026-20854**.

This playbook assumes that **at least two detection rules have triggered** within a short time window on the same host.

## 2. Trigger Conditions

This playbook must be executed when **ANY of the following correlations occur**:

- LSASS memory access + SYSTEM process creation
- LSASS memory access + suspicious SYSTEM logon
- SYSTEM process creation + suspicious SYSTEM logon

---

## 3. Initial Triage (SOC L1 / L2)

### Step 1 – Validate the alert
- Confirm hostname and timestamps
- Verify correlation window (≤ 10 minutes)
- Identify triggering rules

### Step 2 – Context enrichment
- Asset criticality (server / workstation)
- User logged on at detection time
- Patch status for CVE-2026-20854

---

## 4. Investigation Steps (SOC L2 / L3)

### 4.1 LSASS Memory Access Analysis
- Identify process accessing `lsass.exe`
- Review `GrantedAccess` flags
- Check command line and binary path
- Hash lookup (VirusTotal / internal TI)

### 4.2 Privilege Escalation Validation
- Confirm integrity level escalation
- Review parent/child process chain
- Validate if parent process is legitimate

### 4.3 SYSTEM Logon Analysis
- Review EventID 4624
- Check LogonType and LogonId reuse
- Correlate with process creation events

---

## 5. Decision Point

| Findings | Decision |
|--------|---------|
| Legitimate admin / tool | Close as False Positive |
| Unclear / partial | Keep under Investigation |
| Confirmed LSASS abuse | Confirm Incident |

---

## 6. Containment Actions (Confirmed Incident)

- Isolate host from network
- Disable affected user accounts
- Invalidate Kerberos tickets
- Block suspicious hashes / binaries
- Preserve memory dump if possible

---

## 7. Eradication & Recovery

- Remove malicious binaries / services
- Apply CVE-2026-20854 patch
- Reset credentials for impacted users
- Re-enable host after validation

---

## 8. Post-Incident Actions

- Document attack timeline
- Identify lateral movement
- Update detection rules if needed
- Report incident metrics (MTTR, impact)

---

## 9. Severity & Classification

- **Severity:** Critical
- **Category:** Credential Access / Privilege Escalation
- **MITRE ATT&CK:** T1003.001, T1134
