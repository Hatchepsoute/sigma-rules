# RELEASE NOTES – v0.3.0

## SOC Detection Framework Expansion

Version 0.3.0 transforms the repository from a Sigma rule collection into a
**production-ready SOC Detection Engineering framework**.

### Highlights
- Two-tier detection strategy (BROAD / STRICT)
- End-to-end SOC workflow: Detection → Decision → Response
- Campaign-based detection packs from real-world intrusions
- Resilience against payload renaming and tooling evolution (v2/v3)
- Network invariant detections for edge appliances
- SOAR-ready integrations (TheHive, Cortex, Shuffle)
- Multi-SIEM compatibility

### Operational Recommendation
- Use **BROAD** rules for threat hunting and context
- Use **STRICT** rules for alerting, escalation, and automation
