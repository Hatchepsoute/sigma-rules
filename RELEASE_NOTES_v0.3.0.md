# RELEASE NOTES – v0.3.0

## SOC Detection Framework Expansion

Version 0.3.0 transforms the repository from a Sigma rule collection into a **production-ready SOC Detection Framework**.

### Highlights
- Two-tier detection strategy (BROAD for visibility, STRICT for confirmation)
- End-to-end SOC workflow: Detection → Decision → Response
- Multi-CVE coverage with consistent structure
- SOAR-ready integrations (TheHive, Cortex, Shuffle)
- Multi-SIEM compatibility

### Operational Recommendation
Use BROAD rules for threat hunting and contextual visibility.
Use STRICT rules for alerting, escalation, and automated response.
