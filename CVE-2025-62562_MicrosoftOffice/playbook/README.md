# 🐝 SOC Playbook - CVE-2025-62562 (Microsoft Office)
[👉🏾 **French version available here**](./README_FR.md)

This playbook standardizes triage and response for alerts consistent with Office exploitation chains.

## Triggers
- Sigma BROAD: Office spawns LOLBIN/script engine (context / hunting)
- Sigma STRICT: Office spawns LOLBIN with download/execute or obfuscation patterns (alert)

## Analyst  L1 Triage
1. Validate parent is Office (WINWORD/EXCEL/POWERPNT/OUTLOOK/MSACCESS)
2. Capture full process tree and timestamps
3. Inspect command line for URLs, iwr/curl/wget, -enc/IEX/Base64
4. Correlate network egress (proxy/DNS/firewall) to unknown/untrusted hosts
5. Check whether activity is tied to a known IT change (ticket/signed script)

## Analyst L2 Validation
- Apply decision table (Confirmed / Probable / FP)
- Hunt for persistence created shortly after (Tasks, Run keys, services, Startup)

## Response (Confirmed/Probable)
- Isolate host (EDR)
- Kill suspicious child processes
- Block IOC (domain/IP/URL/hash) where feasible
- Quarantine the Office document/email (if available)

## Evidence collection
- Process tree + command lines
- Dropped files in %TEMP% / %APPDATA% / Downloads
- Network connections and DNS queries
- Persistence artifacts created within 0–30 minutes

## Hardening recommendations
- Patch Office across endpoints
- Reduce Office→script engines (ASR/WDAC/AppLocker)
- Enable PowerShell logging (module + script block)
