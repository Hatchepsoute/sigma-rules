# Sigma Rules (BROAD + STRICT) - CVE-2025-62562 (Microsoft Office)
[👉🏾 **French version available here**](./README_FR.md)

This folder contains **two complementary Sigma rules** to detect Office exploitation chains consistent with **CVE-2025-62562**.

Sigma does not detect the vulnerability directly; it detects **observable post-exploitation behavior**.

## Rule 1 -  BROAD
Detects **Office spawning LOLBINs/script engines** (PowerShell/cmd/mshta/rundll32/wscript/regsvr32…).
- Use for **SOC analyst L1 triage** and **threat hunting**
- More visibility, potentially more false positives

## Rule 2 - STRICT
Detects **Office spawning LOLBINs with malicious CLI patterns**:
- URL/download indicators (http/https, Invoke-WebRequest/iwr, curl/wget, bitsadmin/certutil)
- Obfuscation/execution indicators (-enc, FromBase64String, IEX)
- Use for **SOC analyst  L2 confirmation** and **high-severity alerting**

## Operational note
Deploy both rules together:
- BROAD = context and early signal
- STRICT = confirmation and response trigger
