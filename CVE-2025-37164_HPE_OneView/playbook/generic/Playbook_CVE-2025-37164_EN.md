# SOC Playbook – CVE-2025-37164 (HPE OneView)

## Objective
This playbook describes the operational actions a SOC should perform when detecting a suspected or confirmed exploitation of **CVE-2025-37164** affecting **HPE OneView** (Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution).

This document is **tool-agnostic** and can be used without any specific SOAR platform (TheHive, XSOAR, Splunk SOAR, ServiceNow, etc.).

---

## Scope
- HPE OneView
- REST API endpoints (/rest/id-pools)
- OneView web services and related processes

---

## Triggers
- **BROAD alert**: exploitation attempt or scanning activity detected
- **STRICT alert**: confirmed exploitation (command execution)

---

## Operational steps

### 1. Asset identification
- Identify the impacted HPE OneView instance
- Confirm its role (production / non-production)
- Assess network exposure

### 2. Alert qualification
- Determine whether the alert is BROAD or STRICT
- Review event timeline

### 3. Technical analysis
- Review web logs (POST requests to /rest/id-pools)
- Look for injection characters or system commands
- Check for shell or network utility execution

### 4. SOC decision
- **BROAD only**: investigation and enhanced monitoring
- **STRICT or BROAD + STRICT correlation**: critical incident

### 5. Containment (if exploitation confirmed)
- Restrict network access to OneView
- Remove any Internet exposure
- Isolate the appliance if required

### 6. Remediation
- Apply official HPE patches
- Upgrade to a fixed, non-vulnerable version
- Review access controls

### 7. Post-exploitation hunting
- Check for persistence mechanisms
- Identify lateral movement
- Review access to managed systems

### 8. Reporting
- Document the incident
- Notify the CISO and stakeholders
- Feed lessons learned back into detection

---

## Expected outcome
- Rapid containment
- No widespread infrastructure impact
- Continuous SOC improvement
