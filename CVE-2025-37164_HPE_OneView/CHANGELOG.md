## [1.0.0] – 2026-01-13

### 🚀 Initial Release

#### ✨ Added
- **BROAD Sigma rule**
  - Detection of exploitation attempts targeting the HPE OneView   `/rest/id-pools` API endpoint.
  - Coverage of injection characters and system payload indicators.
  - Tagged for threat hunting and early warning (`detection.threat-hunting`).

- **STRICT Sigma rule**
  - Detection of confirmed exploitation via execution of shells,
    network utilities, or interpreters spawned by the HPE OneView service.
  - High-confidence, low false-positive detection.
  - Classified as critical severity.

- **SOC Playbooks**
  - Generic, tool-agnostic SOC playbooks (FR / EN).
  - TheHive-ready playbooks for incident orchestration (FR / EN).

- **Decision Tables**
  - SOC decision tables defining actions for BROAD vs STRICT detections.
  - Available in French and English for L1–L3 analysts.

- **Documentation**
  - README files (FR / EN) explaining detection logic, repository structure,  and SOC usage.
  - Clear separation between detection, decision, and response layers.

#### 🧠 Detection Strategy
- Separation between:
  - **BROAD** (attempt / intent / hunting)
  - **STRICT** (confirmed exploitation / impact)
- Designed for correlation-based incident confirmation.
