👉🏾  [**French version available  here** ](README_FR.md)
## Scope
This playbook applies to **Linux systems** potentially affected by **CVE-2026-24061 (Telnetd Authentication Bypass)**.

---

## Phase 1 : Detection & Triage

**Triggers**
- STRICT Sigma rule (critical)
- BROAD Sigma rule with suspicious context

**Initial Checks**
- Confirm hostname, IP, asset criticality
- Identify triggering rule (STRICT vs BROAD)
- Check for Telnet exposure (TCP/23)

---

## Phase 2: Containment

- Immediately isolate affected host from network
- Block malicious source IPs at firewall level
- Disable Telnet service if still active
- Preserve volatile data if possible

---

## Phase 3 : Investigation

- Review process tree:
  - telnetd → login → shell/tools
- Inspect authentication logs (`/var/log/auth.log`)
- Identify post-exploitation activity:
  - downloads
  - reverse shells
  - persistence mechanisms

---

## Phase 4 : Eradication & Recovery

- Remove unauthorized accounts or keys
- Patch or update vulnerable Telnet components
- Rotate credentials (especially root / privileged users)
- Restore system from trusted backups if required

---

## Phase 5 : Lessons Learned

- Document timeline of exploitation
- Assess detection effectiveness
- Update SOC rules and playbooks
- Enforce Telnet decommissioning policy

---

## Severity Mapping

| Rule Triggered | Severity |
|---------------|----------|
| STRICT | CRITICAL |
| BROAD | HIGH |
