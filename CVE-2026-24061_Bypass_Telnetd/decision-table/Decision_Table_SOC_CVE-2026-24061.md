# SOC Decision Table - CVE-2026-24061 (Telnetd Authentication Bypass)

## Purpose
This decision table helps SOC analysts determine **when to escalate, investigate, or hunt** based on Sigma rule triggers related to CVE-2026-24061.

---

## Detection Inputs

- **STRICT Rule**: `remote_authentication_bypass_telnetd_cve_2026_24061.yml`
- **BROAD Rule**: `process_creation_linux_telnet_cve_2026_24061_broad.yml`
- **Network Context**: Telnet inbound traffic (TCP/23)
- **Endpoint Context**: Linux process creation telemetry

---

## Decision Matrix

| Condition | Confidence | SOC Action | Priority |
|---------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| STRICT rule triggered alone | Very High | Declare security incident, isolate host immediately | CRITICAL |
| STRICT + inbound Telnet traffic | Confirmed exploitation | Incident Response, forensics, credential rotation | CRITICAL |
| BROAD rule triggered alone | Medium | Analyst investigation, validate legitimacy | HIGH |
| BROAD + suspicious network activity | High | Escalate to Incident Response | HIGH |
| BROAD followed by STRICT | Very High | Confirm compromise, full IR workflow | CRITICAL |
| Repeated BROAD triggers same host | Increasing | Threat hunting and containment | HIGH |

---

## Escalation Guidelines

- **STRICT** always overrides BROAD
- Any **root-level process creation** via Telnet is abnormal
- Historical Telnet exposure increases risk score

---

## Notes for SOC Managers

- Treat Telnet exposure as **inherently high risk**
- Use BROAD detections for proactive hunting
- STRICT detections should never be ignored or downgraded
