# When the STRICT Rule Triggers – CVE-2026-20952 (Microsoft Office)

## 🎯 Core Principle

The **STRICT Sigma rule for CVE-2026-20952** triggers **only when all high-risk conditions are met**:

> **Microsoft Office spawns a sensitive child process with explicitly malicious behavior.**

This rule is designed for **production SOC alerting** and focuses on **confirmation of compromise**, not broad hunting.

---

## ✅ Scenarios WHERE the rule TRIGGERS

### 1️⃣ Malicious Office document exploitation

**Scenario**
- A user opens a weaponized Word / Excel / PowerPoint document
- The document exploits a memory corruption vulnerability (Use-After-Free)
- Office spawns a command interpreter or script engine

**Concrete examples**
- `WINWORD.EXE → powershell.exe -EncodedCommand ...`
- `EXCEL.EXE → mshta.exe javascript:...`
- `POWERPNT.EXE → rundll32.exe evil.dll,Export`

➡️ **Immediate trigger**  
➡️ **Very high likelihood of compromise**

---

### 2️⃣ Post-exploitation via Microsoft Office

**Scenario**
- Initial exploitation has succeeded
- Office is abused as the execution context
- Attacker deploys a loader, payload, or C2 channel

**Typical indicators**
- `IEX`
- `FromBase64String`
- `DownloadString`
- DLL loading via `rundll32`

➡️ **Rule triggers**  
➡️ SOC incident requiring escalation

---

### 3️⃣ Fileless malware campaigns delivered through Office

**Scenario**
- No malicious executable written to disk
- In-memory execution via PowerShell or scripting engines
- On-the-fly payload download

➡️ The rule is **specifically built for these scenarios**  
➡️ Extremely low false-positive rate

---

## 🚫 Scenarios WHERE the rule DOES NOT trigger

### ❌ Legitimate Office automation
- Printing workflows
- COM automation
- Business add-ins
- Office launched with `/automation`, `/embedding`, `/pt`

➡️ **Explicitly filtered**

---

### ❌ Scripts or PowerShell executed outside Office
- User launches PowerShell manually
- IT scripts, scheduled tasks
- Parent process is not Office

➡️ **No trigger**

---

### ❌ Office macros without system-level execution
- VBA used only for calculations or formatting
- No external process creation

➡️ **No trigger**

## 🧠 Why this rule is STRICT

| Aspect | Behavior |
|------|---------|
| Parent process | Microsoft Office only |
| Child process | High-risk LOLBins only |
| Arguments | Explicitly malicious |
| Automation | Filtered |
| False positives | Very low |
| SOC usage | Production alert |

---

## 🚨 Real SOC impact

When this rule triggers in production:

- 🔥 This is not noise
- 🔥 This is not a weak signal
- 🔥 This is a **potential security incident**

➡️ Fast L1 triage  
➡️ Justified L2 escalation  
➡️ Containment often required

---

## 🧩 One-sentence summary

> **This rule triggers when Microsoft Office behaves in a way it almost never should: launching an offensive execution engine.**
