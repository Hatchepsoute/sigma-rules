# Decision Table – CVE-2026-20952 (Microsoft Office)
French version available here: [README_FR.md](README_FR.md)

---

## Overview

This directory contains the **decision table associated with CVE-2026-20952**, designed to support SOC analysts in **consistent and fast decision-making** after an alert is triggered by the **STRICT Sigma rule**.

The decision table complements:
- The **STRICT detection rule**
- The **generic SOC playbook**

It translates technical observations into **clear operational decisions**.

---

## Purpose

The decision table helps SOC teams to:

- Quickly determine whether an alert is a **false positive, suspicious activity, or confirmed incident**
- Standardize escalation decisions across **L1 / L2 / L3**
- Reduce analyst subjectivity
- Support training and onboarding of SOC analysts

---

## Scope

- Alerts generated by:
  **Microsoft Office Suspicious Child Process Execution (STRICT)**
- Windows endpoints
- Microsoft Office exploitation and post-exploitation scenarios

---

## Decision Table File

- **Decision Table (Markdown)**:  
  [`Decision_Table_CVE-2026-20952.md`](Decision_Table_CVE-2026-20952.md)

---

## How to Use (SOC Workflow)

1. **L1 Analyst**
   - Review the alert details (parent/child process, command line)
   - Match observations with the decision table
   - Classify the alert (FP / Suspicious / Incident)

2. **L2 Analyst**
   - Validate correlation signals (network, EDR, AMSI)
   - Confirm or downgrade the incident classification

3. **L3 / IR**
   - Use the decision outcome to trigger containment and response playbooks

---

## Confidence Levels

- **Low**: Office child process without suspicious arguments
- **Medium**: Suspicious arguments, no supporting signals
- **High**: Suspicious arguments + network egress or EDR alerts

These confidence levels guide escalation and response actions.

---

## Analyst Notes

- The decision table should be used **together with the playbook**, not in isolation.
- It is designed to reduce noise and ensure **consistent SOC decisions**.
- Adapt thresholds if necessary, but keep logic consistent across teams.
