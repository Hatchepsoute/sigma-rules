# Generic SOC Playbook – CVE-2026-20952 (Microsoft Office)
🇫🇷 French version available here: [README_FR.md](README_FR.md)

---

## Overview

This directory contains a **generic, SIEM/SOAR-agnostic incident response playbook** for handling alerts related to **CVE-2026-20952**, a Microsoft Office **Use-After-Free vulnerability** leading to **local code execution**.

The playbook is designed to be triggered by the **STRICT Sigma rule**:
> *Microsoft Office Suspicious Child Process Execution (STRICT)*

It focuses on **post-exploitation behavior**, not exploit signatures, making it effective even after patching.

---

## Purpose

The playbook helps SOC teams to:

- Perform consistent **L1 → L2 → L3** investigations
- Quickly distinguish **false positives vs real exploitation**
- Apply **rapid containment** to prevent lateral movement or data exfiltration
- Preserve artefacts for **incident response and forensics**
- Improve detection and prevention after the incident

---

## Scope

- Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Access)
- Windows endpoints
- Process creation telemetry (Sysmon / EDR)

This playbook is **generic by design** and can be adapted to:
- TheHive / Cortex
- Shuffle
- XSOAR
- Custom SOAR workflows

## Playbook File

- **Generic YAML playbook**:  
  [`Playbook_CVE-2026-20952_Generic.yml`](Playbook_CVE-2026-20952_Generic.yml)

---

## Workflow Summary

1. **Triage (L1)**
   - Validate Office parent → suspicious child process
   - Review command-line arguments
   - Fast false-positive screening

2. **Investigation (L2)**
   - Process tree and user context analysis
   - Network egress correlation
   - EDR / AMSI signal validation
   - Scope assessment

3. **Containment (L2/L3)**
   - Endpoint isolation
   - Malicious process termination
   - Evidence preservation

4. **Eradication & Recovery**
   - Patch Office
   - Harden Office execution paths
   - Credential hygiene

5. **Post-Incident**
   - Detection tuning
   - Threat hunting
   - Reporting and lessons learned

---

## Analyst Notes

- Microsoft Office **should not spawn command interpreters** during normal usage.
- Combined with encoded or script-based arguments, this behavior is a **high-confidence indicator of compromise**.
- This playbook complements the STRICT detection rule and should be used in **alerting mode**.
