# Microsoft Office Suspicious Child Process Execution (STRICT)
## CVE-2026-20952 - Use-After-Free Local Code Execution

### Overview
This repository provides a **STRICT Sigma detection rule** designed to identify **high-confidence suspicious process execution spawned by Microsoft Office applications**.

The rule focuses on **post-exploitation behavior**, commonly observed after successful exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities such as **CVE-2026-20952 (Use-After-Free)**.

This is a **behavior-based detection**, not a signature tied to a specific exploit, and therefore remains effective **even after patching**.

---

### Detection Goal
Detect scenarios where Microsoft Office applications spawn:
- Command interpreters
- Script engines
- Windows LOLBins

with **clearly malicious arguments** (encoded commands, script execution, remote payload retrieval, DLL execution).

---

### Why Only a STRICT Rule Is Published
This repository intentionally publishes **only a STRICT detection rule**.

A broader hunting rule (BROAD) exists internally but is not shared publicly in order to:
- Avoid false positives
- Prevent alert fatigue
- Ensure immediate usability in production SOC environments

---

### SOC Priority
- Severity: High  
- Confidence: High  
- False Positives: Low  
- Intended Use: Detection / Confirmation  

---

### Deployment Recommendations
- Deploy in alerting mode
- Correlate with network egress, AMSI, and EDR telemetry
- Apply immediate containment upon confirmation
