# 🛡️ Defense Evasion – Security Tool Impairment (Sigma Rules Pack)
👉🏾 [French version available here](README_FR.md)


This open-source Sigma pack detects attempts to **impair, disable, or terminate security tools** (EDR, AV, Microsoft Defender) on Windows systems.

Such behaviors are commonly observed during:
- ransomware pre-encryption phases
- post-exploitation activities
- defense evasion operations (MITRE ATT&CK T1562.001)

The rules are **behavioral**, **SIEM-agnostic**, and designed for **conversion to any backend** (Splunk, Elastic, OpenSearch, QRadar, ArcSight, Wazuh, Sentinel, etc.).

---

## 📂 Included Sigma rules

### 1️⃣ Termination of security processes
**File:**  [`proc_termination_security_processes.yml`](./rules/proc_termination_security_processes.yml)

**Purpose:**  
Detects the termination of known security or EDR processes.

**Detection logic:**
- Observes process termination events
- Matches against common security process names
- Intended as a **contextual signal**, not standalone proof

**Use case:**  
Correlation, investigation pivot, ransomware kill-chain analysis

---

### 2️⃣ Disable security tools via command line (BROAD)
**File:**   [`proc_creation_disable_security_tools_broad.yml`](./rules/proc_creation_disable_security_tools_broad.yml)

**Purpose:**  
Broad detection of attempts to disable or manipulate security tools using command-line utilities.

**Detection logic:**
- Command-line tools (taskkill, sc, net, PowerShell, wmic)
- Generic stop / disable / exclusion patterns
- Defender and security-related targets

**Use case:**  
Threat hunting, early warning, detection of suspicious administrative abuse

---

### 3️⃣ Disable security tools via command line (STRICT)
**File:**   [`proc_creation_disable_security_tools_strict.yml`](./rules/proc_creation_disable_security_tools_strict.yml)

**Purpose:**  
High-confidence detection of explicit security tool disabling.

**Detection logic:**
- Strong patterns such as:
  - `taskkill /F /IM <security_process>`
  - `sc stop WinDefend`
  - `Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring`
- Explicit tool + action + target combinations

**Use case:**  
SOC alerting, automated response, ransomware containment

---

## 🎯 Detection strategy

| Rule | Confidence | SOC Usage |
|---|---|---|
| Process termination | Medium | Correlation / context |
| CLI disable (BROAD) | Medium | Hunting / early detection |
| CLI disable (STRICT) | High | Alerting / response |

**Best practice:**  
Correlate multiple rules within a short time window to increase confidence.

## 🧠 MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

- `T1562` – Impair Defenses  
- `T1562.001` – Disable or Modify Security Tools

---

## ⚠️ False positives & tuning

Possible benign scenarios:
- Legitimate maintenance by administrators
- Endpoint provisioning or hardening scripts
- Incident response containment actions

➡️ Recommended tuning:
- Allowlist known admin scripts
- Exclude golden image build processes
- Correlate with change management windows

---

## 📌 Disclaimer

These rules are provided for defensive purposes only.  
They are generic by design and must be adapted to each environment.

## 🤝 Contributions

Improvements, additional vendors, and correlation ideas are welcome via pull requests.
## Rule relationships
When a pack contains more than one detection, use `related` metadata to link companion rules.
Treat the broader alert as the hunt signal and the stricter alert as the confirmation signal when both exist.
Correlate on the same host, user, or short time window.
