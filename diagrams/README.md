# Sigma-Rules -- Threat to Response Framework

 [👉🏾  **French version favailable here**](README_FR.md)
 
**Threat → Detect → Respond → Improve**

This diagram represents the operational philosophy behind the `sigma-rules` project:\ a structured detection engineering framework designed for real-world SOC environments.

It connects:

-   Threat intelligence and CVE analysis\
-   Sigma rule development (BROAD + STRICT layers)\
-   SIEM integration\
-   SOC triage and decision guidance\
-   SOAR-enabled incident response\
-   Continuous detection tuning

The model is tool-agnostic and compatible with modern SIEM and SOAR platforms.

### Executive Value

-   Reduced MTTD\
-   Reduced MTTR\
-   Standardized SOC operations\
-   Improved detection maturity\
-   Continuous security improvement
