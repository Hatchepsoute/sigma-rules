# 🧠 Decision Table - AI Agent Context Theft
👉🏾 [French version available here](README_FR.md)


## Purpose
Guide SOC analysts in triaging alerts related to AI agent identity and context theft (OpenClaw and similar agents).

---

## 🟡 BROAD - Suspicious Access to AI Agent Files

| Condition | Yes | No |
|---------|-----|----|
| Access to `.openclaw` directory | Continue | Close |
| Sensitive file accessed (`openclaw.json`, `SOUL.md`, `MEMORY.md`) | Continue | Close |
| Process non-interactive / unexpected | Escalate L2 | Monitor |
| Repeated access in short time | Increase confidence | Monitor |

Action:
- Hunting alert
- Correlate with process + network activity

---

## 🔴 STRICT – Authentication Secrets Exfiltration

| Condition | Yes | No |
|---------|-----|----|
| `openclaw.json` accessed | Continue | Close |
| Process from Temp/AppData/Downloads | Escalate L3 | Monitor |
| Process not legitimate agent | Incident | Monitor |
| Outbound network activity | Confirm compromise | Pending |

Action:
- Isolate host
- Revoke tokens
- Audit AI agent actions

---

## 🔴🔴 CRITICAL - Cryptographic Identity Compromise

| Condition | Yes | No |
|---------|-----|----|
| `device.json` / `.pem` accessed | Incident | Close |
| Private key present | Confirm incident | Investigate |
| Unexpected process | Immediate IR | Investigate |

Action:
- Rotate keys
- Regenerate agent identity
- Full IR workflow

---

## 🔴🔴 CRITICAL - Multi‑File Access

| Condition | Yes | No |
|---------|-----|----|
| Auth + Crypto + Memory files accessed | Full compromise | Investigate |
| Same process involved | Immediate IR | Investigate |

Action:
- Assume full agent takeover

## Detection chain and rule relationships
When a pack contains multiple detections, `related` links the companion rules so SOC analysts can pivot from context to confirmation.
Use the broader alert as the hunt signal and the stricter alert as the confirmation signal when both exist.
