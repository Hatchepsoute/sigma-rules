# 🧠 SOAR Playbooks — CVE-2025-6218 (WinRAR)

This directory contains **SOC & SOAR playbooks and implementations** related to the exploitation of **CVE-2025-6218**, a critical WinRAR vulnerability allowing directory traversal, arbitrary file write, and persistence.

The objective is to bridge **detection (Sigma)** and **response (SOAR)** using clear, reusable, and tool-agnostic logic.

---

## 📄 Generic SOAR Playbooks (Reference)

These playbooks define the **standard response logic**, independent of any specific SOAR tool.

- 🇬🇧 **English (reference version)**  
  ➜ `SOAR_Playbook_CVE-2025-6218_EN.md`

- 🇫🇷 **Version française**  
  ➜ `SOAR_Playbook_CVE-2025-6218_FR.md`

---

## 🔔 Detection Scope (Sigma Rules)

The playbooks are based on the following Sigma detections:

- 🟧 **Exploitation signal**  
  `WinRAR_Path_Traversal_Extraction_CVE-2025-6218.yml`  
  Detects WinRAR extraction with directory traversal patterns.

- 🟥 **Post-exploitation / persistence signal**  
  `WinRAR_Persistence_Startup_Write_CVE-2025-6218.yml`  
  Detects extracted files written into Windows persistence locations.

➡️ **Correlation of both rules within 10 minutes indicates confirmed exploitation.**

## 🧩 SOAR Implementations (Tool Examples)

### 🐝 TheHive (Case-Driven SOAR)
Path:
```
playbook/implementations/thehive/
```

- Case templates
- SOC N1 / N2 / N3 task workflow
- Severity & TLP mapping
- Custom fields (host, user, command line, dropped file)
- Optional Cortex responders

📄 File:
- `TheHive_Playbook_CVE-2025-6218.md`

---

### 🔀 Shuffle (Automation-Oriented SOAR)
Path:
```
playbook/implementations/shuffle/
```

- Visual workflow logic
- STRICT vs BROAD+ style decision paths
- Correlation timer (10 minutes)
- Automated containment actions (EDR, quarantine)
- Ticket / case creation

📄 File:
- `Shuffle_Workflow_CVE-2025-6218.md`

⚠️ Shuffle is used here as a **conceptual orchestration example**.  
No Shuffle deployment is required to understand the workflow.

## 📊 Diagrams & Executive View

Visual representations of the SOAR logic:

- 📽️ **Executive overview (PPT – 1 slide)**  
  `CVE-2025-6218_SOAR_Executive_Slide.pptx`

These diagrams illustrate how Sigma alerts are operationalized through
TheHive (decision-making) and Shuffle (automation).

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

- 🔍 **Detection-first** (Sigma)
- 🧠 **Decision-driven** (SOC logic & correlation)
- 🤖 **Automation where it adds value**
- 🧩 **Tool-agnostic by design**

> Detection without response is incomplete.  
> This playbook set closes the gap between alerting and action.
