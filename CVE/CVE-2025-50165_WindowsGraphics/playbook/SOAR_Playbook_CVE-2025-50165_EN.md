# 🧠 SOAR Playbook — CVE-2025-50165 (EN)
## Client-Side Exploitation (Renderer ➜ LOLBin)

🇫🇷 French version available here:
➡️ SOAR_Playbook_CVE-2025-50165_FR.md

---

## 🎯 Purpose
This playbook defines the SOC and SOAR response workflow for detections related to CVE-2025-50165 (Windows Graphics Component).
Its goal is to operationalize Sigma detections into concrete response actions, reduce MTTR, and standardize incident handling.

---

## 🔔 Detection Triggers
### 🔴 STRICT Rule (High confidence)
Triggered when a document or image renderer spawns a LOLBin with explicitly malicious command-line patterns.

### 🟠 BROAD+ Rule (Suspicious)
Triggered when a renderer spawns a LOLBin with suspicious indicators requiring investigation.

---

## 🧩 Decision Tree
SIGMA ALERT → STRICT → Immediate containment  
SIGMA ALERT → BROAD+ → Investigation → Escalation or Closure

---

## 🔁 SOAR Pseudo-Code
If STRICT:
- Isolate endpoint
- Kill process
- Block IOCs
- Create IR case

If BROAD+:
- Analyze CLI
- Correlate telemetry
- Escalate if confirmed

---

## 🛡️ Containment Actions
- Endpoint isolation
- Process termination
- IOC blocking
- Credential reset if needed

---

## 🧠 MITRE ATT&CK
- T1203 Exploitation for Client Execution
- T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter
- T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer

---

## 📌 Key Message
We do not detect the malicious document — we detect the moment exploitation becomes real.
